Overview
========

PlayFab is the PlayFab integration plugin for [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/) that makes REST server communications to the PlayFab back-end service streamlined. This plugin is based of Ufna's VaRest plugin. The core JsonObject and JsonValue is his work. The integration of the PlayFab APIs is mine.

Key features:

* Flexible Http/Https request management with support of different Verbs and Content Types
* **No C++ coding required**, everything can be managed via blueprints
* Blueprintable FJsonObject wrapper with almost full support of Json features: different types of values, **arrays**, both ways serializarion to FString, etc.
* Blueprintable FJsonValue wrapper - **full Json features made for blueprints!**
* [PlayFab](https://PlayFab.com) REST API manager to start working with PlayFab out of the box!

Current version: **1.0**
